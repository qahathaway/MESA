# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Deep Neural Survival Networks: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)

# Background:
There is growing interest in utilizing machine learning techniques for routine atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk prediction. We investigated whether novel deep learning survival models can augment ASCVD risk prediction over existing statistical and machine learning approaches.

# Methods:
6,814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were followed over 16 years to assess incidence of all-cause mortality (mortality) or a composite of major adverse events (MAE). Features were evaluated within the categories of traditional risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and imaging markers. Data was split into an internal training/testing (four centers) and external validation (two centers). Both machine learning (COXPH, RSF, and lSVM) and deep learning (nMTLR and DeepSurv) models were evaluated.
