# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Deep Neural Survival Networks: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)

Background: Circulating inflammatory and imaging biomarkers can enhance routine atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk prediction; however, the information regarding the most optimal combination of biomarker-guided screening strategies remains limited. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether novel deep learning survival models can augment ASCVD risk prediction by creating a framework that outcompetes other machine learning methods and conventional statistical approaches through extracting non-linear interactions between different sets of biomarkers.

Methods: 6,814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were followed over 16 years to assess incidence of mortality or mortality + MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events). Features were evaluated within the categories of traditional risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and imaging markers (left ventricular morphology, pericardial fat and coronary artery calcium (CAC)). Data was split into an internal training/testing (four counties) and external validation (2 counties). Models examined included cox proportional hazards regression model (COXPH), random survival forest, support vector machines, and deep neural networks. The concordance index, cumulative/dynamic AUC, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and relative risk (RR) were implemented in evaluation.
