Leveraging Deep Neural Survival Networks for Event Prediction and Feature Selection: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)

Aims: The purpose of the study is to provide an evaluation of machine and deep learning models when applied to survival analysis and to define how combinations of features can shape the learning environment and, ultimately, inform clinical decision making.

Methods and Results: 6,814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were followed over 16 years to assess the incidence of mortality or a composite outcome (cardiovascular morbidities and mortality). Features were evaluated within the categories of traditional risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and left ventricular function/structure. Data was split into a ~66% internal training/testing (field centers 3, 4, 7, 8) and ~33% external validation (field centers 5, 6). Models examined included proportional hazards, random survival forest, support vector machines, and deep neural networks. The concordance index, applying inverse probability of censoring weights, and cumulative/dynamic AUC were used for evaluation.
